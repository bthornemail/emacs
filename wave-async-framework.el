;;; wave-async-framework.el --- Async/await framework with hybrid execution

;; Copyright (C) 2024 Axiomatic
;; Author: HÂ²GNN Development Assistant
;; Version: 1.0.0
;; Keywords: async, await, timer, process, hybrid, wave-function
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1") (cl-lib "1.0") (wave-y-combinator "1.0"))

;;; Commentary:
;; Implements hybrid async/await framework with timer and process-based execution:
;; - Timer-based: Simple periodic checks, works in batch mode
;; - Process-based: Separate Emacs processes, full parallelism
;; - Hybrid: Timers for UI, processes for heavy computation
;; - Try/catch: Error handling with async awareness
;; - Await: Polling-based result waiting with timeout
