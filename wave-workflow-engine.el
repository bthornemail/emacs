;; Version: 1.0.0
;; Keywords: workflow, yaml, read-eval-print-loop, async, wave-function
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1") (cl-lib "1.0") (wave-y-combinator "1.0") (wave-async-framework "1.0"))

;;; Commentary:
;; Implements YAML-configurable workflow engine with {read, eval, print, loop} operations:
;; - YAML parser for workflow definitions
;; - {input, source, output, target} configuration
;; - {async, try, await, catch} error handling
;; - {subject-predicate-object-modality} SPO framework
;; - Integration with Y-combinator and async framework
